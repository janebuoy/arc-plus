**Light theme now available!**

Arc+ brings the [Arc GTK theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) into Visual Studio Code with some small asthetic changes loosely based off of the [Fresh Material](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2ndshift.fresh-material) Code theme. Light *and* dark themes are available.
